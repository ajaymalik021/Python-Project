Before uploading, I made sure to check everything thoroughly:

    Code Readability:
        I’ve added comments and structured the code well to ensure it’s easy to understand.
        All variable names are descriptive, making the logic clear.

    Testing:
        I’ve tested the system with various inputs, including edge cases like invalid product names or negative quantities.
        The discount calculations and receipt generation work perfectly.

    Features Highlighted:
        My project can handle multiple items in a single transaction.
        It applies dynamic discounts based on the total bill.
        It generates a detailed and itemized receipt for the customer.
        It allows continuous input until the transaction is complete.

    Presentation:
        I’ve added a brief introduction at the beginning of the script to explain the project’s purpose.
        I also included a sample output of an itemized receipt in the documentation to showcase the program’s capabilities.

    Upload:
        I saved my script with a meaningful name, supermarket_billing_system.py.
        If I’m uploading it to a repository (like GitHub), I’ve prepared a README file to explain the project, its features, and how to run it.
